# uLisp Bignums Extension
A small arbitrary-precision extension for uLisp, for calculating with large integers.

It is designed to work on any 32-bit uLisp platform. To add these functions simply compile and upload uLisp with the file Bignums.ino included in the same folder as the uLisp source file for your platform, and the bignum functions will be added to the built-in functions in uLisp.
